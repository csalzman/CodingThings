ordinal numbers are what we think of like 1-100
cardinal numbers are a way in which to index numbers includes 0 as the starting number

animals = ['bear', 'python', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']

The python is at 1 and is the 2nd animal.
The python is the 2nd animal and is located at animal[1].

The third animal is the peacock and it is located at animal[2]. Another way to put it is that it's indexed using a cardinal number of 2.

The 1st animal is the bear and it is at 0.

The animal at 3 is the kangaroo and it's the fourth animal.

The fifth animal is a whale and it is at animal[4], or the fourth index using cardinal numbers.

The animal at 2--or animals[2]--is the peacock. It's the third animal.

The sixth animal is the platypus. It's the last animal in the set.

ordinal == ordered
cardinal == cards at random, 0
